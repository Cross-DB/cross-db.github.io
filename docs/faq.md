# FAQ

## Why is it called CrossDB?

This DB can be used across many areas: 

* Lightweight Embedded DB
* High-performance OLTP DB
* IMDB/OnDisk DB/Hybrid DB
* Manage runtime data to replace STL, collection or hand-written data structures
* Data-driven development
* Native language trigger
* Support JSON
* Embedded and Standalone Server
* Data PUBSUB
* Data Replication
* As Redis Server
* As MySQL Server
* etc

So it's not just an embedded DB.

## Why is `CrossDB` so fast?

* Use memory map to access DB data directly (so your DB must less than the main memory to get highest speed).
* Use high-performance hash as the main index, and use the super fast wyhash as the hash function.
* Hand-written SQL parser which is more than 10X faster than Flex/Bison parser tools.
* High-performance read-write lock and multi-core optimization.
* Execute multiple SQL statements in one API, which will imporve client-server DB performance dramatically.
* High-efficient client-server protocols.
* Avoid memory allocation/free as much as possible.
* High-performance implementation code


## Why not use scanner and parser tool like Flex/Bison?

CrossDB uses hand-written scanner and hand-written recursive descent parser.

* Hand-written scanner/parser is smaller, about 1/3 COL generated by Flex/Bison tools.
* Hand-written scanner/parser is more efficient, about 10X faster and Flex/Bison tools.
* Hand-written scanner/parser is more portable.
* Hand-written scanner/parser is fully reentrant and thread-safe.
* Hand-written scanner/parser provides better error messages.
* Hand-written scanner/parser is more easy to read code and debug.
* Hand-written scanner/parser is more easy to optimize.
