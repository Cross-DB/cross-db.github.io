# Introduction

**CrossDB** is a powerful high-performance embedded RDBMS database. It's developed to 
improve development efficiency for embedded application or embedded system development. 

## Features

- Support Multiple OS Platform: Linux/Windows/MacOS etc
- Support X86/ARM/PPC/MIPS etc CPU
- Support OnDisk/In-memory/RamDisk Storage
- Support Primary Key and multiple Secondary Index
- Support Standard HASH and BTREE Index
- Support Multi-columns Index
- Support Exact Match, Leftmost Match, Range Match
- Support C/C++ Struct/Union ORM APIs
- Support Struct Scheme Auto upgrade/downgrade
- Support almost all C data types
- Support rich DEC/HEX/BIN/Bitmap/MAC/IPv4/IPv6/Timestamp formats
- Support Standard Transaction (begin/commit/rollback)
- Support WAL for OnDisk storage
- Dynamic Growing/Shrinking Table
- Support Multiple Threads and Multiple Processes Access
- Support Table level read/write lock
- Super High Performance
- Very Robust: Process Restart, Process Crash, Power Cycle
- Very Simple: Simple header and library file
- Zero Config: no complex config, real out-of-the-box

## Use Cases

- You can use CrossDB RDBMS to Manage Program Runtime Data efficiently.
- You can use CrossDB transaction to do persistency storage on Disk/Flash with ACID feature.
- YOu can use CrossDB to support Process Restartability, In-Service Software Upgrade(ISSU) easily.
- You can use CrossDB RDBMS to refactor your code conveniently.
- You can use CrossDB Index to optimize performance without changing your code.

<!--
- You can use CrossDB Trigger to implement Data-Driven programming paradigm.
- You can use CrossDB PUBSUB to subscribe DB from other process's DB either on same host or remote host.
- You can use CrossDB to implement Centralize-DB programming paradigm.
- You can use CrossDB eventloop to implement event-driven programming paradigm.
- You can use CrossDB RPC to build distributed service.
- You can use CrossDB CLI tool to debug running program's data in off-line way.
- You can use CrossDB SQL to view/create/update/delete/filter program data.
- You can use CrossDB Browser to view program data.
- You can use CrossDB to do DB backup restore it.
- You can use CrossDB DB Change Log to view DB change history with filter, backtrace, rate-limit, expiring, etc.
- You can use Python connector to write unit test with SQL to test program.
- You can copy the DB folders from device and open on PC/Server with CrossDB-cli or Python directly.
- Use CrossDB DB-Driven Mode to Build Program Logic (Table Trigger, FK, auto delete, Cascade Trigger)
- Use CrossDB Python Connector to do DB-Driven Unit Test
- Use CrossDB Pub/Sub to Build Distributed System (Eventloop/Timer/WorkQueue, vs IPC, OOP [priv data])
- Use CrossDB Pub/Sub to Build Centralized DB-Driven System (3rd lang, DM no checkpoint)
- CrossDB Serialization and RPC
- CrossDB SQL Connectors (RESP3, Python)
- CrossDB SQL Drivers (C, Python)
