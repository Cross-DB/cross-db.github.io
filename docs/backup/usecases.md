# Products

CrossDB(CDB) is a powerful high-performance distrubuted embedded SQL RDBMS database. It's developed to 
improve development efficiency for embedded programmers. 

CrossDB combines on-disk and in-memory data storage in a single embedded database system, so developers can optimize applications for speed and persistence, giving you flexibility to prioritize between performance, cost, power, and space-conserving storage options. Offering native and SQL APIs for C, C++, and Python.


# Feature List
