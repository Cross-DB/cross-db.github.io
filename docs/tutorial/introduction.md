# Introduction

CrossDB(CDB) is a powerful high-performance distrubuted embedded SQL RDBMS database. It's developed to 
improve development efficiency for embedded programmers. 

* You can use CDB RDBMS to Manage Program Data efficiently.
* You can use CDB transaction to do persistency storage on Disk/Flash with ACID feature.
* YOu can use CDB to support Process Restartability, In-Service Software Upgrade(ISSU) easily.
* You can use CDB RDBMS to refactor your code conveniently.
* You can use CDB Index to optimize performance without changing your code.
* You can use CDB Trigger to implement Data-Driven programming paradigm.
* You can use CDB PUBSUB to subscribe DB from other process's DB either on same host or remote host.
* You can use CDB to implement Centralize-DB programming paradigm.
* You can use CDB eventloop to implement event-driven programming paradigm.
* You can use CDB RPC to build distributed service.
* You can use CDB CLI tool to debug running program's data in off-line way.
* You can use CDB SQL to view/create/update/delete/filter program data.
* You can use CDB Browser to view program data.
* You can use CDB to do DB backup restore it.
* You can use CDB DB Change Log to view DB change history with filter, backtrace, rate-limit, expiring, etc.
* You can use Python connector to write unit test with SQL to test program.
* You can copy the DB folders from device and open on PC/Server with cdb-cli or Python directly.
* Use CDB DB-Driven Mode to Build Program Logic (Table Trigger, FK, auto delete, Cascade Trigger)
* Use CDB Python Connector to do DB-Driven Unit Test
* Use CDB Pub/Sub to Build Distributed System (Eventloop/Timer/WorkQueue, vs IPC, OOP [priv data])
* Use CDB Pub/Sub to Build Centralized DB-Driven System (3rd lang, DM no checkpoint)
* CDB Serialization and RPC
* CDB SQL Connectors (RESP3, Python)
* CDB SQL Drivers (C, Python)
